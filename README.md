# BogoStalinSort
2nd Best sorting method after Bogosort

After spending months and countless hours to create the new best sorting method, I realized I can't bogo sort is just too good.
So I started working on the 2nd best sorting method, after watching a top 10 worst sorting mehtods video (link down below)
I decided on 2 things:
1) the shuffle from bogo sort needs to stay
2) Stalin sort sounds funny and I need to include it

so I created BogoStalin sort.
Essentially works like bogo sort, but before it shuffles it eliminates the first index of the item that breaks the ascending order
Can only sort in ascending order
